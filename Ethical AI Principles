# 🧑‍⚖️ Ethical AI Principles for Open Nest

## 📢 Overview
Project Open Nest is committed to **building trauma-informed, ethical AI** for social impact. Our AI models must be **fair, transparent, privacy-conscious, and designed to protect vulnerable communities**.  

This document outlines the **core ethical principles** guiding Open Nest's AI development.

---

## ⚖️ **1. Fairness & Bias Mitigation**
- AI should **not discriminate** based on race, gender, disability, or socio-economic status.
- We will **proactively audit** datasets and models for bias.
- Implement **Fair AI practices**, including:
  - Regular **bias testing** on datasets.
  - **Human-in-the-loop validation** to prevent automated discrimination.
  - **Open-source fairness tools** (e.g., IBM AI Fairness 360).

---

## 🔍 **2. Transparency & Explainability**
- AI models should provide **clear, interpretable decisions**.
- Users must have access to **explanations** of AI-generated outcomes.
- We will implement:
  - **Model cards** documenting training data and performance.
  - **Explainable AI (XAI) techniques** to improve model interpretability.
  - A **public audit trail** for key AI decisions.

---

## 🔒 **3. Privacy & Data Protection**
- AI should respect **user privacy** and **minimize data collection**.
- Open Nest will follow **HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2** compliance guidelines.
- Privacy-by-design principles:
  - **No unnecessary data collection.**
  - **Differential privacy** and **data anonymization** techniques.
  - **Encryption & access controls** to protect sensitive data.

---

## 🛡 **4. Safety & Security**
- AI should be **resilient against misuse, hacking, and adversarial attacks**.
- We will implement:
  - **Adversarial robustness testing** to prevent model manipulation.
  - **Security reviews** before deploying AI models.
  - **Continuous monitoring** for potential vulnerabilities.

---

## 🤖 **5. Human-Centered AI**
- AI should **enhance human decision-making, not replace it**.
- Trauma-informed AI must be:
  - **Emotionally intelligent** (considering user well-being).
  - **Context-sensitive** (adapting to diverse social and healthcare settings).
  - **Guided by ethical oversight** from social work, mental health, and governance experts.

---

## 📜 **6. Accountability & Governance**
- AI must have **clear responsibility frameworks**.
- Open Nest will:
  - Establish an **AI Ethics Board** for oversight.
  - Ensure **publicly available audit logs** for major AI decisions.
  - Offer **recourse mechanisms** for individuals affected by AI decisions.

---

## 🏛 **7. Open Source & Community-Led Governance**
- AI systems should be **open-source, auditable, and community-driven**.
- We commit to:
  - **Transparent AI development** with public discussions.
  - **Accepting external audits & feedback** from ethics researchers.
  - **Community input on AI improvements and policies**.

---
